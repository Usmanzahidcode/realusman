        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I believe in systems that serve people, not the other way around. My approach is to take complex requirements and shape them into solutions that are
            lean, understandable, and resilient. Good engineering is about removing friction and making room for progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            I care about balance, building only what is needed, but doing it with enough depth that it lasts. I like solving problems at the point where
            business
            goals and technical execution meet, making sure what gets built actually moves things forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of my work lives in backend infrastructure, connecting APIs, databases, and cloud services into one dependable whole. The goal is always the
            same, systems that teams can rely on and scale without hesitation.

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m drawn to opportunities where I can design backend systems, connect parts into full solutions, and support products through growth. The real
            reward is transforming complex challenges into clear, dependable systems that last.

    <p>
        This page is intentionally simple, fast to load and clear to read, the same way I aim to build systems, practical, scalable, and made to last.
